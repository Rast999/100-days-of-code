# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Andrei D.

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 26, Saturday, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started a personal web-site. Looked into bootstrap documentation and similar sites to choose a layout.

### R1D2
Made a footer for the site i'm going to build. Need to read some js documentation.

### R1D3
Readed some js documentation. Reminded myself of object behaviour and inheritance. Tinkered with javascript objects. Started to look into vuejs docs. Tomorrow will finish the site/blog content block design.

### R1D4
Spent some time reading jQuery docs, then made my site top navigation bar fixed to the top, changing it's colour/dimensions when scrolling. Plan is to finish the minimal frontend this week to start looking into Flask with Python on the weekend.

### R1D5
Today tried to lay out the central part of the web page. Pretty sure I will have to change it later. Tomorrow will try to add some js interactivity to that part.

### R1D6
Short day. Didn't accomplished what planned, but still played with some bootstrap grid today.

### R1D7
Went through little bit of Flask. Spend a lot of time resolving something which was just a cached css file.
